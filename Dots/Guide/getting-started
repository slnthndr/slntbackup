Welcome to GeoDots, a simple, customizable, and lightweight Hyprland configuration.

1. How can I get started?

First of all, you should understand that Hyprland is an advanced window manager, meant for users that are willing to learn. You shouldn't use Hyprland if you want a system that 'just works', or want a system that doesn't change.

While these Dotfiles are made to be as easy as possible, you will undoubtedly encounter issues, some of which may be issues with the Dotfiles, but most times will generally be on you, or your setup.

You should know:
- How to read documentation
- How to learn/use commands effectively
- How to edit configuration files

While technical experience will help significantly, all of this is attainable with time and effort. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files (generally found in the .config folder) that control behaviors/aspects of your system, including applications, tools and scripts. 

The term "dotfiles" comes from the fact that these files typically are found in a Folder (or Directory) that starts with a dot (.), making them hidden by default.

In the context of Hyprland, Dotfiles define the behavior, appearance, keybindings, and other user preferences of your system.

Some people will post these configurations online, so that others copy them to their system and can use them. 

GeoDots is simply a collection of configurations that I have decided to upload, and have provided easy scripts for installing and managing them.

3. What if I have problems/issues with this setup?

You should firstly determine if the issue you are experiencing is related to these dotfiles, or if they are an issue with Hyprland, Linux, or how you have set something up.

I would start by creating a Virtual machine (or using another device), and installing Hyprland WITHOUT the use of my dotfiles (read the Hyprland wiki on how to do this). 

If the issue occurs on a fresh Hyprland install, the issue is likely with Hyprland or a specific program. If the issue isn't already documented (look for others with the same problem), you can go ahead and submit a bug report. Make sure you report the bug for the right software (e.g Lock screen bugs should be reported to the Hyprlock repo, app bugs should be reported to that specific apps repo).

If the issue doesn't occur on a fresh install, it still may not necessarily be the dotfiles fault (e.g a misconfiguration issue). Try installing the dotfiles on the same virtual machine, and see if it happens there. If it doesn't happen on the virtual machine, its probably an issue you have created, or another program on your setup has messed with (e.g KDE plasma messing with dark mode/light mode switching, etc). 

If the issue only occurs with the use of my dotfiles, please submit a bug report! If I am able to replicate your issue, I will get to work asap.
